1. inventory for material, eg. detergent, plastic bag, fabcon.
2. inventory for cleaned clothes, with names from clients, 
   quantity of the laundry (1 plastic bag of cleaned laundry should 
   be at 7kg max). along with how many material was used 
   (1 cleaned laundry would use 2 fabcons, 1 detergent, and 1 plastic bag)
3. inventory for not yet cleaned clothes, same things for the cleaned one

so most likely 3 arrays
