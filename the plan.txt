1. inventory for material, eg. detergent, plastic bag, fabcon.
2. inventory for cleaned clothes, with names from clients, 
   quantity of the laundry (1 plastic bag of cleaned laundry should 
   be at 7kg max). along with how many material was used 
   (1 cleaned laundry would use 2 fabcons, 1 detergent, and 1 plastic bag)
3. inventory for not yet cleaned clothes, same things for the cleaned one

so most likely 3 arrays
a way to delete, add, update each of the three array.
a way to move the uncleaned clothes to cleaned clothes array.
what i need are: 
a way to update the materials and laundry 
a way to delete and add 
a way to check inventory 
a sorting method via quantity 
a way to filter, low stock, status of laundry 
materials should have name, qty, price laundry 
should have client name, qty of laundry (total kg of laundry divided by max_weight), status (clean/pending)
there's only 3 materials that will most likely be used (detergent, fabcon, laundry bag)
